# Cursor Rules for MobiFai Project

## Git Workflow
- **NEVER automatically commit changes unless explicitly asked by the user**
- **NEVER automatically push to master unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Only stage, commit, and push when the user specifically requests it with commands like:
  - "commit this"
  - "push this"
  - "commit and push"
  - "save this to git"
- When making code changes, just make the changes and wait for the user to decide when to commit

## Project Context
- This is a React Native mobile app that connects to a Mac terminal via WebRTC P2P
- The relay server facilitates the initial connection
- Terminal rendering uses xterm.js in a WebView
- Current network: IP 192.168.178.72 (may change)
