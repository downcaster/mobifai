# Cursor Rules for MobiFai Project

## Git Workflow

- **NEVER automatically commit changes unless explicitly asked by the user**
- **NEVER automatically push to master unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Only stage, commit, and push when the user specifically requests it with commands like:
  - "commit this"
  - "push this"
  - "commit and push"
  - "save this to git"
- When making code changes, just make the changes and wait for the user to decide when to commit

## Project Context

- This is a React Native mobile app that connects to a Mac terminal via WebRTC P2P
- The relay server facilitates the initial connection
- Terminal rendering uses xterm.js in a WebView
- Current network: IP 192.168.178.7 (may change)

## Design System & UI

- **Framework**: React Native + NativeWind (Tailwind CSS).
- **Theme**: Material Light (Default). Use `bg-primary`, `bg-surface`, `text-black` etc.
- **Components**: ALWAYS prefer reusable components from `mobile/src/components/ui/`.
  - `AppText` for typography.
  - `AppButton` for actions.
  - `AppCard` for containers.
  - `AppView` for layout.
- **Icons**: Use standard unicode or SVGs if needed. Avoid adding heavy icon libraries unless necessary.
