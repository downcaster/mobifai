# Quick Start Guide - MobiFai

Get your Mac terminal connected to your phone in 5 minutes!

## What You're Building

```
Your Mac  ←→  Relay Server (Cloud)  ←→  Your Phone
```

## Step 1: Start Relay Server (One Time Setup)

Choose one option:

### Option A: Run Locally (Testing)

```bash
cd relay-server
npm install
npm run dev
```

✅ Server running at `http://localhost:3000`

### Option B: Deploy to Railway (Free, Recommended)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
cd relay-server
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

✅ Server running at `https://your-project.railway.app`

---

## Step 2: Start Mac Client

```bash
cd mac-client
npm install

# Edit .env to point to your relay server
echo "RELAY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000" > .env
# OR for Railway:
echo "RELAY_SERVER_URL=https://your-project.railway.app" > .env

# Start the client
npm run dev
```

You'll see:

```
🖥️  MobiFai Mac Client
================================

📡 Connecting to relay server: http://localhost:3000...
✅ Connected to relay server

✅ Mac registered. Share this code with your mobile device.

🔑 Pairing Code: 847392

Share this code with your mobile device to connect.
Code expires in 5 minutes.
```

**⚠️ COPY THE 6-DIGIT CODE!** You'll need it in the next step.

---

## Step 3: Setup Mobile App

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
```

A QR code will appear. Scan it:
- **iOS:** Use Camera app → tap "Open in Expo Go"
- **Android:** Use Expo Go app to scan

---

## Step 4: Connect!

In the mobile app:

1. **Enter Relay Server URL:**
   - Local: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Railway: `https://your-project.railway.app`

2. **Enter Pairing Code:** (from Step 2)
   - e.g., `847392`

3. **Tap "Connect"**

You'll see:

```
📡 Connecting to relay server...
✅ Connected to relay server
✅ Mobile device registered. Enter pairing code to connect.
🔗 Pairing with code: 847392...
✅ Successfully paired with Mac

========================================
Terminal ready. Start typing commands!
========================================
```

## Step 5: Try It Out!

Type commands in your phone:

```bash
ls
pwd
echo "Hello from my phone!"
cd ~/Documents
```

Everything runs on your Mac! 🎉

## Troubleshooting

### Mac Client Won't Connect

```bash
# Make sure relay server is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok", ...}
```

### Mobile App Can't Pair

1. **Code expired?**
   - Codes expire after 5 minutes
   - Stop Mac client (Ctrl+C)
   - Restart it to get a new code

2. **Wrong relay server URL?**
   - Make sure URL matches exactly
   - Include `http://` or `https://`
   - For local: use your Mac's IP on same WiFi

3. **Already paired?**
   - Only one mobile per Mac
   - Disconnect other mobile first

### Terminal Not Responding

- Check Mac client logs for errors
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting
- Restart Mac client

---

## Using Over Internet (Not Local Network)

If you want to connect from anywhere:

### 1. Deploy Relay Server to Cloud

Use Railway, Heroku, or any hosting service (see Step 1, Option B)

### 2. Use Cloud URL

In Mac client `.env`:
```bash
RELAY_SERVER_URL=https://your-relay.railway.app
```

In mobile app:
```
https://your-relay.railway.app
```

Now it works from anywhere with internet! 🌐
